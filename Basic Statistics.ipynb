    "### 1. Explain what is meant by the term population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A population is any specific collection of objects of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explain what is meant by the term sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sample is any subset or subcollection of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Explain how a sample differs from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sample can also contain all elements from population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explain what is meant by the term sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The measurement of sample elements are collectively called Sample Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Explain what a parameter is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A parameter is a number that summarizes some aspect of the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Explain what a statistic is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statistic is a number computed from the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Give an example of a population and two different characteristics that may be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the people from a specific city that vote. \n",
    "- The two different characteristics would be gender Male and Female.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Describe the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Illustrate with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descritpive stats = is a branch of stats that involves organizing, displaying, and describing data.\n",
    "- Inferential stats = involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample data taken from that population."
